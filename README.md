# Image Tile Set Generator

The tile generator will take a full size image and extract tile sets at multiple zoom levels, scaling by half for each tile set.  This produces a range of tiles that can be used for slippy maps or other applications.

The tile generator currently uses the Python Imaging Library, and soon will have support for VIPS.
